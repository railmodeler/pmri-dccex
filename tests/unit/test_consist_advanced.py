"""DCC-EX advanced consist (CV19) end-to-end test.

DCC-EX has no CS-side consist opcode, so consist options on this
driver are:

* ``kind="software"`` (default) -- send throttle commands to each
  loco individually via ``<t>``.
* ``kind="advanced"`` (CV19) -- write CV19 on each member decoder;
  then throttle commands to the consist address fan out on the
  layout because the decoders themselves respond. Uses the DCC-EX
  ops-mode CV write (``<w cab cv value>``) via the base
  ``ConsistManager._program_cv19`` path.

This test verifies that opting a consist into ``advanced`` correctly
fires the ``<w>`` opcodes for each member -- the deferred item from
the beta 3 workitem doc.
